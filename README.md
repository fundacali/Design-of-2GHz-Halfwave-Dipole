# CST Design-of-2GHz-Halfwave-Dipole



The main goal was to learn how to design and model a simple **Half-Wave Dipole Antenna** for electromagnetic simulation.

## Design Details

| Parameter | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frequency (F)** | 2 GHz | The frequency the antenna is designed for. |
| **Antenna Length (L)** | ~70.4 mm | Calculated length for half-wave resonance. |
| **Wire Radius (R)** | ~0.147 mm | The thickness of the dipole arms. |
| **Feeding Gap (G)** | ~0.352 mm | The small space where the energy is fed. |
| **Port** | Discrete Port | Used to define the energy source (impedance set to 73 Ohms). |
